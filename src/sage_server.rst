The SAGE Server establishes and maintains a connection between SAGE Nodes and any integrated external Controller application.

All communication shared across the agent network propagates through the SAGE Server enabling it to provide the following services:

	- Create and destroy Agents
	- Manage Agent behaviors
	- Activate and deactivate Agents
	- Send messages to Agents
	- Retrieve Behavior execution results
	- Synchronize their execution with SAGE behaviors.
	- Hosts the Behavior repository
	- Manage Behavior delivery
