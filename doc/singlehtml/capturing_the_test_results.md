Capturing the Test Results

Capturing the Test Results
==========================

A Result object provides a reporting mechanism back to the server to
indicate the results of the execution of a Behaviorâ€™s methods.

The m\_logMessages member is a vector of strings and is intended to
provide a log of events that occurred during the execution of a
Behavior.

You can capture messages back to your Robot report by appending to this
m\_logMessages list:

``` {.sourceCode .java}
public boolean action(Result result)
{
    System.out.println("Hello World from Action");
    result.m_logMessages.add("This is log message string3.");
    result.m_executionResult = ExecutionResultType.CompletionSuccess;
    return true;
}

public boolean message(Message message, Result result)
{
    System.out.println("Got message");
    result.m_logMessages.add("This is log message from message string1.");
    result.m_executionResult = ExecutionResultType.CompletionSuccess;
    return true;    
}
```

As a result, your Robot log should read:

``` {.sourceCode .bat}
This is log message string3.

This is log message from message string1.
```

While your console reads:

``` {.sourceCode .bat}
Hello World from Action

Got message
```

All execution logs and results are pushed back to the Server. Logs and
results can be found on the **Server machine** in the following
directories:

``` {.sourceCode .bat}
Logs directory: "C:\ProgramData\SAGE\logs"

Results directory: "C:\ProgramData\SAGE\results"
```
