Sentry AGEnts (SAGE) is a multi-agent framework designed as an enabeling technology for research, development, and deployment of distributed agent systems. SAGE has been used across a wide range of applications including: automated test and validation of complex systems-of-systems, autonomous control of unmanned systems, workflow automation, development of complex systems in highly dynamic, uncertain environments, and distributed simulation. SAGE maintains a small footprint; it is implemented in C++ and uses an extremely efficient, and widely used interprocess communication capability, Remote Call Framework, for agent interaction, (See https://www.deltavsoft.com). 

The deisgn of SAGE was motivated by Herbert Simon's ideas on the architecture of complexity. SAGE, therefore, inherently supports the idea of emergent configurations of holonic systems through dynamical agent composition by agents.   

While SAGE adheres to proper agent semantics, it was designed to also be pragmatic so that it can easily integrate into new or existing software systems and infrastructure. SAGE provides interface libraries that allow external applications to build, control, and interact with SAGE agent networks. SAGE Agents can also interact with their surrounding sofware environment wherever that may be. SAGE includes an interactive agent development environment called SAGE App where you can interactively build, experiment with, visualize, and store agent networks.

SAGE is free software and has no dependencies that require paid licenses or impose restrictions on distribution. SAGE is an open, containerized system that can run on a wide range of platforms from servers to IOT devices.
