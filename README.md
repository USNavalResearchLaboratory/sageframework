SAGE Framework is a multi-agent system designed as an enabeling technology for the research, development, and deployment of agent systems that address wide range of problems including: automated testing of distributed systems, emergent agent configurations, novel agent reasoning algorithms, and distributed simulation. SAGE maintains a small footprint; it is implemented in C++ and uses a highly efficient, and widely used IPC/RPC [Remote Call Framework](www.deltavsoft.com).

SAGE is free software and has no dependencies that require paid licenses or impose restrictions on distribution. SAGE is an open system that can interact with external systems, and can run on a variety of platforms from servers to IOT devices.

SAGE was designed to be pragmatic so that it can easily integrate into new or existing software systems. SAGE provides interface libraries that allow external applications to build, control, and interact with SAGE agent networks. SAGE Agents can also interact with their surrounding sofware environment wherever that may be. SAGE includes an interactive agent development environment called SAGE App where you can interactively build, experiment with, visualize, and store agent networks.
