SAGE makes automating complex systems simple.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
Language Agnostic:
   SAGE is designed so that behaviors can be written in a wide range of programming languages. SAGE currently supports behaviors written in C++, Java, and Python.   

Open Integration:
   SAGE provides powerful software interfaces that facilitate tight integration between SAGE agents and external software systems.

SAGE Clusters:
   SAGE supports a fog computing model with dynamic discovery. SAGE servers can dynamically discover and connect to other server instances so that agents can communicate across cloud boundaries.
		
Easy to use:
   SAGE Server and Node are containerized so that they can be easily deployed where they are needed using any container management platform.
